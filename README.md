# Move.it

This application provides a way to stay active while using your computer or mobile devices. With it you use the idea of the pomodoro technique of a timer plus body exercises.

It's very simple: start the timer (25 minutes by default), complete the challenge that will appear after the cycle and gain experience. It is done with:

  - Next.js
  - Typescript
  - Context API
  - Hooks
  - React
  - js-cookie

The final version can be found here: https://move-it-eight-tan.vercel.app/

```git clone https://github.com/JadsonBruno/move.it.git```

SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. If you have a SSH key registered in your Github account, clone the project using this command:

```git clone git@github.com:JadsonBruno/move.it.git```

### Instal dependencies

After clone, install the dependencies and devDependencies.

```sh

Now you can access http://localhost:3000/ to see the main page.

## Usage
